Here are the inputs of the assignments related to the specific topic.

- _**Basics:**_
1) Hello World!
2) Variables
3) Data types
4) Type Casting

- _**Operators:**_
   - **Arithmetic Operators-** This program demonstrates arithmetic operations in C, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
   - **Relational Operators-** This program compares two integers, a and b, using relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==) and prints the results. The output is in boolean values, where 1 represents true, and 0 represents false.
   - **Ternary Operators-** This program illustrates the use of logical operators:
         * Logical AND (&&) checks if both conditions are true.
         * Logical OR (||) checks if at least one condition is true.
         * Logical NOT (!) negates the truth value of a condition.
It prints results based on the truth or falsity of the given conditions.

   - **Assignment Operators-** This program demonstrates the use of compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to modify the value of an integer a. The updated values of a are printed after each operation.
   - **Bitwise Operators-** This program uses bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~) to manipulate the binary representation of two integers, a and b. It performs AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations, printing the results.
   - **Ternary Operators-** This program demonstrates the ternary operator (? :) to determine the greater of two integers, a and b. The larger value is assigned to max and printed as the result.
  

- _**Conditional Statements:**_
1) if-else Statements:
   -    **Average Marks-** This C program calculates the total and average marks from five subjects and then assigns a grade 
                           based on the average percentage. It takes input for each subject, calculates the total score, 
                           computes the average, and displays the appropriate grade.
   -    **Eligibility for Working-** This C program takes the user's age as input and determines their work eligibility. It 
                                     categorizes the user as a minor, eligible for working, or ready for retirement based on 
                                     the age entered.
   -    **Grades based on marks-** This C program assigns a grade based on the user's marks out of 100. It uses nested `if` 
                                   statements to categorize grades as A, B, C, D, or F (fail) based on the entered score.
        

3) for loop:
   -    **Even Numbers-** This C program prompts the user to enter a number and then prints all even numbers from 0 up to that number. It uses a `for` loop and checks if 
                          each number is even using the modulus operator.
   -    **Odd Numbers-** This C program prompts the user for a number and then prints all odd numbers from 1 up to that number. It uses a `for` loop and checks each 
                          numberâ€™s parity, printing the next odd number for each even `i`.
   -    **Factorial-** This C program prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates its factorial using a `for` loop. It initializes the factorial to 1, multiplies 
                        it by each integer up to the entered number, and then displays the resulting factorial.
4) while loop
5) do while
6) Switch Case:
   -    **Day-** Prompt the user to enter a number, then print the corresponding day of the week.
   -    **Month-** Prompt the user to enter a number, then print the corresponding month of the year.
   -    **Food Menu-** This program allows users to select food items from a menu, enter the quantity for each, and view the subtotal and final total bill. It uses a 
                       'switch' statement to calculate the cost based on the chosen items and quantities.
   -    **MCQ-** This C program quizzes the user on which cricket team has won the most World Cups. It provides four options, takes user input, and checks the answer using 
                   a `switch` statement to display whether the choice is correct or incorrect.

- _**Patterns:**_
   -   **Pyramid-** This C program prints a pyramid pattern of asterisks. The user inputs the number of rows, and the program displays a centered triangle of that height using nested loops.
   -   **Right Half Pyramid-** This C program prints a left-aligned triangle of asterisks. The user enters the number of rows, and the program displays a triangle with increasing stars per row.
   -   **Left Half Pyramid-** This C program generates a right-aligned triangular pattern of stars (`*`) based on the number of rows entered by the user. It uses nested loops to control spacing and star placement.
   -   **Reverse Pyramid-** This C program generates an inverted right-aligned triangular pattern of stars (`*`) based on the number of rows input by the user. It uses nested loops to manage leading spaces and star placements.
   -   **Reverse-Right Half Pyramid-** This C program creates an inverted triangular pattern of stars (`*`), with the number of rows determined by user input. It uses nested loops to print decreasing numbers of stars in each row.
   -   **Reverse-Left Half Pyramid-** This C program generates an inverted triangle pattern of stars (`*`) that is right-aligned, with the number of rows determined by user input. It uses nested loops to add increasing spaces and decreasing stars for each row.
 
- _**Arrays:**_
   - **Matrix Multiplication-** This C program performs matrix multiplication. It prompts the user to input the dimensions and elements of two matrices, validates if the multiplication is possible (i.e., the number of columns in Matrix A equals the number of rows in Matrix B), and computes the resultant matrix. The program then prints the input matrices and their product in a formatted way.
