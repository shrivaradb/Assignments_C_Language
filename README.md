Here are the inputs of the assignments related to the specific topic.

- _**Basics:**_
1) **Hello World!**
      * This program is a simple "Hello World" program. It uses the printf function to print the text "Hello World" to the console.
2) **Variables**
   * This program demonstrates the declaration, definition, and usage of a variable:
Declaration: Declaring an integer variable a.
Definition: Assigning a value to a.
Usage: Modifying a by adding 16 to its value and printing the result.
3) **Data types**
   * This program showcases three basic data types in C:
Integer (int): Represents whole numbers.
Float (float): Represents decimal numbers.
Character (char): Represents single characters.
It declares variables of each type, assigns values, and prints them using appropriate format specifiers (%d, %f, %c).
4) **Type Casting**
   * This program demonstrates:
Integer addition using c = a + b.
Type casting to float with d = (float)a + b, converting one operand to a float, resulting in a floating-point output. Both results are printed using %d for integers and %f for floats.
- _**Operators:**_
   - **Arithmetic Operators-** This program demonstrates arithmetic operations in C, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
   - **Relational Operators-** This program compares two integers, a and b, using relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==) and prints the results. The output is in boolean values, where 1 represents true, and 0 represents false.
   - **Ternary Operators-** This program illustrates the use of logical operators:
Logical AND (&&) checks if both conditions are true.
Logical OR (||) checks if at least one condition is true.
Logical NOT (!) negates the truth value of a condition.
It prints results based on the truth or falsity of the given conditions.
   - **Assignment Operators-** This program demonstrates the use of compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to modify the value of an integer a. The updated values of a are printed after each operation.
   - **Bitwise Operators-** This program uses bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~) to manipulate the binary representation of two integers, a and b. It performs AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations, printing the results.
   - **Ternary Operators-** This program demonstrates the ternary operator (? :) to determine the greater of two integers, a and b. The larger value is assigned to max and printed as the result.
  

- _**Conditional Statements:**_
1) **if-else Statements:**
   -    **Average Marks-** This C program calculates the total and average marks from five subjects and then assigns a grade 
                           based on the average percentage. It takes input for each subject, calculates the total score, 
                           computes the average, and displays the appropriate grade.
   -    **Eligibility for Working-** This C program takes the user's age as input and determines their work eligibility. It 
                                     categorizes the user as a minor, eligible for working, or ready for retirement based on 
                                     the age entered.
   -    **Grades based on marks-** This C program assigns a grade based on the user's marks out of 100. It uses nested `if` 
                                   statements to categorize grades as A, B, C, D, or F (fail) based on the entered score.
        

2) **for loop:**
   -    **Even Numbers-** This C program prompts the user to enter a number and then prints all even numbers from 0 up to that number. It uses a `for` loop and checks if 
                          each number is even using the modulus operator.
   -    **Odd Numbers-** This C program prompts the user for a number and then prints all odd numbers from 1 up to that number. It uses a `for` loop and checks each 
                          numberâ€™s parity, printing the next odd number for each even `i`.
   -    **Factorial-** This C program prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates its factorial using a `for` loop. It initializes the factorial to 1, multiplies 
                        it by each integer up to the entered number, and then displays the resulting factorial.
2) **while loop**
   * This program demonstrates the while loop in C. It initializes an integer i to 20 and prints its value in each iteration. The loop decrements i by 1 in each iteration and runs as long as i is greater than 0.
4) **do while**
   * This program demonstrates the do-while loop in C. It initializes an integer i to 0 and prints "shrivaradb" in each iteration. The loop runs until i is less than 5, incrementing i by 1 in each iteration. The do-while loop ensures the body is executed at least once.
5) **Switch Case:**
   -    **Day-** Prompt the user to enter a number, then print the corresponding day of the week.
   -    **Month-** Prompt the user to enter a number, then print the corresponding month of the year.
   -    **Food Menu-** This program allows users to select food items from a menu, enter the quantity for each, and view the subtotal and final total bill. It uses a 
                       'switch' statement to calculate the cost based on the chosen items and quantities.
   -    **MCQ-** This C program quizzes the user on which cricket team has won the most World Cups. It provides four options, takes user input, and checks the answer using 
                   a `switch` statement to display whether the choice is correct or incorrect.

- _**Patterns:**_
   -   **Pyramid-** This C program prints a pyramid pattern of asterisks. The user inputs the number of rows, and the program displays a centered triangle of that height using nested loops.
   -   **Right Half Pyramid-** This C program prints a left-aligned triangle of asterisks. The user enters the number of rows, and the program displays a triangle with increasing stars per row.
   -   **Left Half Pyramid-** This C program generates a right-aligned triangular pattern of stars (`*`) based on the number of rows entered by the user. It uses nested loops to control spacing and star placement.
   -   **Reverse Pyramid-** This C program generates an inverted right-aligned triangular pattern of stars (`*`) based on the number of rows input by the user. It uses nested loops to manage leading spaces and star placements.
   -   **Reverse-Right Half Pyramid-** This C program creates an inverted triangular pattern of stars (`*`), with the number of rows determined by user input. It uses nested loops to print decreasing numbers of stars in each row.
   -   **Reverse-Left Half Pyramid-** This C program generates an inverted triangle pattern of stars (`*`) that is right-aligned, with the number of rows determined by user input. It uses nested loops to add increasing spaces and decreasing stars for each row.
 
- _**Arrays:**_
   - **Matrix Multiplication-** This C program performs matrix multiplication. It prompts the user to input the dimensions and elements of two matrices, validates if the multiplication is possible (i.e., the number of columns in Matrix A equals the number of rows in Matrix B), and computes the resultant matrix. The program then prints the input matrices and their product in a formatted way.
 
-_**Structures:**_
   - **Student Details Code-** This program defines a Student structure and collects details (name, roll number, and marks) of five students using loops. It then displays the entered details for all students. Proper handling of string input is used to accommodate spaces in names.
   - **Employee Details Code-** This program defines an Employee structure and collects details (name, email address, phone number, age, and blood group) for two employees. The details of both employees are then displayed. Input handling is basic, and improvements like using fgets for strings can enhance robustness.
   - **Books Details Code-** This program defines a Books structure and initializes details of a book (title, author, and subject). The data is copied to another book structure, and the details of both books are displayed. The focus is on showcasing structure usage and string manipulation.
