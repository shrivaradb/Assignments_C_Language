   -Even Numbers: This C program prompts the user to enter a number and then prints all even numbers from 0 up to that number. It uses a `for` loop and checks if each number 
                  is even using the modulus operator.
   -Odd Numbers: This C program prompts the user for a number and then prints all odd numbers from 1 up to that number. It uses a `for` loop and checks each numberâ€™s parity, 
                 printing the next odd number for each even `i`.
   -Factorial: This C program prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates its factorial using a `for` loop. It initializes the factorial to 1, multiplies it by 
               each integer up to the entered number, and then displays the resulting factorial.          
4) while loop
5) Switch Case:
